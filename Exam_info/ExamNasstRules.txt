Rules for all exams:

    Closed book, closed notes, closed electronics (no laptops, tablets, phones, etc.)

    Bring:

        Rutgers photo id with a legible picture. If you don't have one or your picture is rubbed out, bring a driver's license. If you do not have either, contact Prof. Francisco at least a week before the exam.

        Pencils, erasers, etc.

        Watch. Do not use your cellphone as a watch.

        Backpack, purse, etc. You must put your cellphone, tablet, iPod, VR goggles, sonic screwdriver or other electronic devices off your person and out of reach in a bag or container of some sort. The only exception is a watch that only has time-related functions (e.g. not a “smart watch”, not a calculator watch).

		
    Make-up Exams:

        If your reason is foreseeable and incipient (occurred after the semester started), you must make arrangements for a make-up at least two weeks in advance.

        If your reason is not foreseeable, e.g. auto crash or medical emergency, you must get in contact with Prof. Francisco as early as you can. Send an email to deymious@yahoo.com and see him during office hours (at worst, before/after class). You must have written documentation of the problem, e.g. a police report or a doctor's note.

		
    Grading Questions:

        If you have a question about the grading on a project or exam you must bring it to the attention of the teaching staff within two weeks of the grade being posted or the assessment being returned to you.
