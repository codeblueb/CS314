
Project 1 Extra:
	For extra credit, solve the list length problem detailed in class. For the following definition:
	
lstlength([], SIZE):- SIZE is 0.
lstlength([_|T], SIZE):- lstlength(T, SMALLER), SIZE is SMALLER+1.

	.. asking Prolog to assemble a random list of a given size ("lstlength(X,3)") indicates more possible solutions, which I demonstrated runs forever.
	
	Solve the issue by counting the list's length using Peano Numerals. You should also write a rule to relate integers to Peano Numerals.

Optionally submit your "PeanoLength.pl" on or before the due date as well.
